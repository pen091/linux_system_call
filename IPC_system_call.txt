Inter Process Communication (IPC) system calls

Allowing processes to exchange information and notify each other of events is one of an operating systemâ€™s most important jobs. The Linux kernel implements most of the historic Unix IPC mechanisms - including those defined and standardized by both System V and POSIX - as well as implementing a mechanism or two of its own. IPC mechanisms supported by Linux include pipes, named pipes, semaphores, message queues, shared memory, and futexes.
