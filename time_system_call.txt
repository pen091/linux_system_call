Time system calls

The kernel measures the passage of time in three different ways: wall time (or real time), process time and monotonic time. These three measurements of time may be represented in one of two formats: relative time and absolute time. Managing the passage of time on a Linux system involves several tasks, only some of which any given process is concerned with: they include setting and retrieving the current wall time, calculating elapsed time, sleeping for a given amount of time, performing high-precision measurements of time, and controlling timers. This is accessible via Linux time system calls.
