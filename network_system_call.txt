Network system calls

Like most other Unix-based operating systems, Linux supports TCP/IP as its native network transport. Network system calls is the way to make communications between computes via different kind of network interfaces: wired and wireless devices, fiber channel and etc. Most of network operations are based on BSD sockets interface.

Sockets allow processes on different computers to exchange data through a network. Sockets can also be used as a communication tool for processes located on the same host computer; the X Window System graphic interface, for instance, uses a socket to allow client programs to exchange data with the X server.
