File system calls

The file is the most basic and fundamental abstraction in Linux. Linux
follows the everything-is-a-file philosophy. Consequently, much interaction
transpires via filesystem system calls such as reading of and writing to 
files, even when the object in question is not what you would consider
your everyday file.

In order to be accessed, a file must first be opened. Files can be opened for reading, writing, or both. An open file is referenced via a unique descriptor, a 
mapping from the metadata associated with the open file back to the specific 
file itself. Inside the Linux kernel, this descriptor is handled by an integer 
(of the C type int) called the file descriptor, abbreviated fd. File descriptors are shared with user space, and are used directly by user programs to access
files. A large part of Linux system programming consists of opening, 
manipulating, closing, and otherwise using file descriptors.
